## 🚀 Overview

Yuri402 is a decentralized AI computation layer that enables builders to create, deploy, and monetize AI workflows in an open network.

Design powerful workflows.  
Deploy them permissionlessly.  
Earn from every execution.

No gatekeepers. No centralized bottlenecks. Just open computation.

## 💰 Monetization Logic (Concept)

- Each execution is logged
- Performance is tracked
- Rewards distributed automatically
- Builders earn based on usage & efficiency

---

## 🔐 Trustless by Design

- On-chain settlement ready
- Transparent execution logic
- Verifiable workflow outputs
- No centralized control

---

## 🌱 Getting Started
